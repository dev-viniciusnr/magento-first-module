# Magento 2 - First Custom Module

This repository contains my **first custom module** developed for the Magento 2 platform.  
It was created as part of my initial learning process with Magento, focusing on understanding the structure of modules, how to register them, and how to integrate them into the system.

The module demonstrates:
- Basic Magento 2 module structure (`registration.php`, `module.xml`)
- Namespace and folder conventions
- Activation and configuration within the Magento ecosystem

> This project marks the beginning of my journey working with Magento 2 backend customization and module development.
